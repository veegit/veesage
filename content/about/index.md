# Hello, I'm Vee

Welcome Humans and AI Overlords. I'm passionate about building systems that don't break when millions of people try to pay for stuff at the same time. Turns out that's harder than it sounds.

## What I Do

I like building fault tolerant systems and highly correct systems. I have dabbled in all of them - RiskTech, BondTech, Developer Toolkits, SaaS Commerce and Agent Commerce. I've spent 15+ years building such platforms that somehow manages to stay up even when everything else is on fire.
I have served users and their developer personas and nowdays I serve my development team(s). 

## My Interests

- **Human and AI Development**: Building intelligent systems that augment human capabilities and Growing Humans who can wield the technology
- **Creative Writing**: Writing fictional stories and real-life experiences
- **Technical Writing**: Sharing insights about AI, programming, and technology
- **Backpacking**: Exploring new heights and trails 

## Connect

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss AI, agents, or anything tech-related. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations.
