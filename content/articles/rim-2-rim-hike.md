# The Grand Canyon Rim to Rim Adventure: How We Almost Died (But Didn't)

So my buddy Ameet and I decided to walk across the Grand Canyon. You know, like normal people do. We started planning this crazy idea way back in August 2014, because apparently we needed 9 months to mentally prepare for walking into a giant hole in the ground.

## The Planning (Or: How We Spent $972.79 to Walk)

We booked our hotels in August, got our permit in December, and then spent the next 5 months watching YouTube videos about making beer can stoves. Appreciate Ameet for being on top of all the booking and keeping me motivated till the D-Day.

Here's what we bought:
- A DIY coke can stove - watched that [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGyPtxh1b-U) like 50 times
- A tiny water filter that looked like a toy
- Backpack and other packing materials from some random online store but endorsed by Bear Grylls - http://giftsformenoutlet.com/
- $27 worth of fuel (for the stove)


## Day 1 (May 18): The Calm Before the Storm

We took Avatar Shuttle from Phoenix to the North Rim. It was very prompt and comfortable ride. We stopped to eat in Phoenix downtown and the heat was unbearable. Made me rethink the whole adventure

Stayed at North Kaibab Lodge. Last real bed for a while. Should have enjoyed it more.

## Day 2 (May 19): Going Down Is Easy, Right?

Started our hike down the North Kaibab trail. Only 7 miles to Cottonwood campground. "This is easy!" we said. Our knees disagreed after mile 3.

The views were crazy. Like, stop-every-5-minutes-to-take-pictures crazy. Other hikers kept passing us and I learned the hiking etiquette of nodding the head. 

Set up our tent at Cottonwood. Cooked dinner on our coke can stove. The stove worked though and was surprisingly powerful.

## Day 3 (May 20): Right in the middle

Another 7 miles down to Bright Angel Campground. Saw a rattle snake on the trail. Harmless but the sound was ominous.

Made it to Bright Angel Campground. Just dropped dead on the ground and took some time to setup the tent. The evening sun was serene.

Fun fact: There's a place called Phantom Ranch down here. It has beds and showers but was booked months in advance.


## Day 4 (May 21): Going Up Is Not Like Going Down

Woke up. Ate breakfast at the canteen. Packed lunch. Started climbing.

5 miles up to Indian Garden. Doesn't sound like much until you realize it's ALL UPHILL. IN THE DESERT.

The view was insane though. You can see the river and the inner canyon. Worth being extra tired.

Indian Garden has trees! And shade! We've never been so happy to see plants.

## Day 5 (May 22): The Final Push

Last 4.5 miles to the South Rim. The longest 4.5 miles of our lives. 

People coming down kept saying "You're almost there!" They were lying.

But then... WE MADE IT! South Rim! Civilization! Toilets that flush!

Stayed at Thunderbird Lodge. Showered for like an hour. Ate like Kings. Life was good.

## Day 6 (May 23): Back to Reality

Took the shuttle back to Phoenix. The same driver was impressed!

## The Numbers That Matter

- Miles hiked: 24ish (plus side trips because we're overachievers)
- Elevation change: Don't ask
- Blisters: Too many
- Times we questioned our life choices: Hourly
- Times we'd do it again: In a heartbeat
- Next Trip Planned: Havasupai (_Another Blog post perhaps_)

## Pro Tips from Amateur Hikers

1. That coke can stove? It works and is extremely light. Suggest bringing a dropper to suck up the excess fuel for later. Thanks Ameet the brains!
2. The water filter is not a toy - it will save your life
3. Book everything early (we started in August for a May trip)
4. Kathmandu Curry FTW
5. Your knees will hate you
6. Invest in a good water filter but don't hook it to water bag since it will slow the flow down. 
7. The views make it all worth it

Total damage: $972.79 and some sore muscles. Would we recommend it? Absolutely.
